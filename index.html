            <h3>Acquatic life powered by chemical reactions</h3>
            <p>
                Oceans are a vital part of our Eath ecosystem. Moreover, about 71% of our planet is covered by water, says NASA. Some people even joke it’s better to call it Water, not Earth!
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile, common ocean worlds are powered by sunlight, atmosphere, and biological processes, some aquatic habitants definitely know how to survive in the places that are not as comfortable!
These facts give explorers a right to create a hypothesis that can be ocean worlds powered by chemical reaction in different environments. 
                <br><br>
                Let us discover the unique ocean called Ionica. It is powered by chemosynthetic processes. We will later form conclusions on whether it is possible for such habitats to exist, if yes, what special features they have. But the is more to it – can we actually create and use such ecosystems on Earth?
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="glass">
            <h3>The soil</h3>
                <p>Firstly, the ocean floor of Ionica is full of vibrant hydrothermal vents, similar to those found on Earth, but more varied in composition. Some vents eject superheated mineral-rich gases while others release cold, alkaline fluids rich in hydrogen and methane. The seabed is laced with high-density networks of porous rocks, allowing for the filtration of gases that support chemosynthetic life. These geological dynamics create a mosaic of unique habitats that maintain a complex food web. NASA <a href = "https://www.nasa.gov/specials/ocean-worlds/">1</a> research shows that chemical markers in the water of our oceans suggest that plenty of the water came from asteroids. <a href = "https://www.nasa.gov/specials/ocean-worlds/">2</a>
                    
                </p>
                
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="glass">
            <h3>The atmosphere</h3>
                  <p> The atmosphere is thin, consisting mainly of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with a limited amount of methane and trace gases. According to ScienceHub <a href = "https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/141-environmental-conditions-affecting-the-sea">3</a>, oxygen is a very important gas in the ocean because of its role in the life processes of marine organisms. Dissolved oxygen in seawater comes from mixing (where the surface meets the atmosphere) and as a byproduct of photosynthesis.   
                   <br><br>
                    However, photo- and chemosynthesis are not forms of energy production. They are forms of energy storage. Both photo- and chemosynthesis need a source of energy to work; in the case of photosynthesis, that's the light of the sun. But some chemosynthetic organisms here on Earth use the energy supplied by hydrothemal veints. This chemical process is called Hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis.<a href = "https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/237570/is-a-planet-where-chemosynthesis-replaces-photosynthesis-possible">4</a>  They are used by a variety of bacteria, which is a food for shrimp, octopuses and other acquatic animals.  
                  </p>
            </div>
        <br>

        <div class="glass">
            <h3>Meet the acquatic buddies</h3>
                  <p> Another meaningful part of our ocean’s environment is fauna. Jacques Cousteau's expeditions to hydrothermal vents, particularly through his exploration of the East Pacific Rise, played a crucial role in bringing attention to extraordinary ecosystems around. Moreover, his study of extremophiles (organisms that thrive in extreme environments) has implications for the search for extraterrestrial life, as similar conditions may exist on moons like Europa or Enceladus. 
                      <br><br>
                    Although extremophiles often look unusual or even ugly to the human eye, their structure, and behavior that help them survive in extreme conditions are a subject of interest for Ionica’s modeling. More precisely, their adaptation mechanisms are key for Ionica’s inhabitants.
                  <br><br>
                    In the Ionica ocean, biological processes are tightly woven into the geological features of the environment. Continuous volcanic activity introduces new minerals into the ocean, ensuring a steady supply of nutrients for microbial life and fostering genetic diversity through adaptations to changing chemical landscapes. Life has evolved to depend on chemosynthesis, particularly on sulfur and methane, while adapting to the salinity and pH level of waters.

                       Dominant microorganisms thrive in the gaseous environments surrounding hydrothermal vents, utilizing hydrogen sulfide and methane as energy sources; these microbes form the base of the food web, creating biofilms around vents that serve as a primary nutrient reservoir.

                    Fungal drifting species resemble a combination of Earth’s fungi and soft-bodied corals; they have extensive networks of filamentous structures (hyphae) that anchor them to the substrate and absorb nutrients. Some species can secrete enzymes that break down organic material and utilize the resulting molecules for energy.

                    <p>Larger creatures feeding on microbial mats and filamentous fungi could also be present; their bodies are adapted to the high pressure and low light of the deep ocean, with bioluminescent features providing communication signals for mating and social interaction.

            <h3>Fantastic? Not too fantastic!</h3>
                  <p> Ionica exemplifies a habitable ocean world driven by intricate chemosynthetic processes instead of photosynthesis, showcasing the resilience and adaptability of life in the universe. The interplay of geology and biology in this alien ecosystem opens up exciting possibilities for understanding life beyond Earth, broadening the horizon of potential habitats and the diversity of life forms that might exist elsewhere in the cosmos. But can we use it right now without waiting for a ticket to the mysterious planet?
                      <br><br>
                    Due to the Earth’s ocean water pollution and deep-sea mining, some chemotrophic species like sea pangolins are endangered. <a href = "https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/tamuoto/shows/hydrothermal-vents">5</a> This process can continue eating up on fauna. That is why while we are still cleaning our oceans from plastic and chemicals like oil, it is important to preserve those habitats as well. We can make it by establishing enclosed artificial habitats powered by both chemosynthesis and photosynthesis for these species to thrive.
                      <br><br>
                    Let us turn our discoveries into action: the journey to secret planets begins from the place we are standing!
